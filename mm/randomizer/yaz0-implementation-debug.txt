When doing second comparison for skip-byte check, there was a small implementation difference:
- Test checked if: result2.length >  result1.length + 2
- Leg. checked if: result2.length >= result1.length + 2

Seems like Test implementation is not recognizing at least 0x111 bytes of value 0,
at offset 0x1A1A (should only need to look back 1 byte).

Issue was with for-loop comparing for number of matches. If max number (0x111),
would not exit loop early and set match count, leaving it at 0.
